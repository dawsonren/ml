# Learn Machine Learning with Liam and Dawson!

Overall Goal: Create a ML algorithm that clones someone's voice.

First Goal: Understand PyTorch and see how high we can get a CIFAR-10's performance to be (look at Kaggle leaderboard for comparison.)

PyTorch: Version 2.6.0. To install, [this link](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
